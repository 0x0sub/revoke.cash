Close to $3M worth of NFTs has been stolen from users of the peer to peer platform NFTTrader, mostly made up of Bored Apes and Mutant Apes. It is still uncertain how this exploit has happened, so we will update this page when more is known. The exploiter has sent several stolen NFTs back to the victims, so there is hope that users will recover some of their assets.
